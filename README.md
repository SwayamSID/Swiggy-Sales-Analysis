# _Steps involved in process:_

## 1. üîé Web Scrapping:
Swiggy's content is dynamic, thus a traditional iteration across pages was not feasible.  Rather, the website was continuously scrolled through by automation, which retrieved data as it loaded dynamically. The         automation script was created to simulate user activity by using webdriver and Selenium. It scrolled along the Swiggy website to record the dynamically loaded content.  This method made it possible to retrieve more    data than what was initially displayed on the screen.  The script successfully retrieved the data as it scrolled down, guaranteeing a complete dataset for additional analysis.  The code for website automation is as   follows:

iii. Based on the quantity of restaurant ratings, an emphasis was made on assessing the popularity of various locations.
